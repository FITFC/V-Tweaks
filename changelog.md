# 3.0.1

## Fixed

* Imperishable enchant causing weird visual glitch on tools
* Imperishable enchant not working on sword attacks
* Imperishable enchant not working on sword breaking blocks
* Imperishable enchant not working on armor

# 3.0.0

#### Initial Port

## What won't be coming

* Sheep Dye Fix - may return if still needed
* Horse Armor Recipes

## What's ready but doesn't work yet

* Cake drops - they're implemented but forge isn't firing the event that it utilizes

## What's changed with the port

* Crop Harvest Tweak doesn't swing arm (I can't figure this out w/o using packets)
* Imperishable - I can't figure out how to add the Book to nether fortress loot, so the recipe is an anvil recipe of **Unbreaking III books** on both sides.
* All texts are now translatable - this includes ChallengerMobs' names, the welcome text on first world join, and more.
