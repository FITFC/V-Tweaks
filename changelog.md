# V-Tweaks Changelog MC 1.15.x

## 3.1.8

### Changed

- Bumped Forge and MCP mappings

### Fixed

- Pack version for the mod's resources

## 3.1.7

### Fixed

- The `/give` command appearing to drop an extra item that didn't exist

### Changed

- Challenger Mobs' blacklist is now based on the name you use when you `/summon` them!! This makes it much easier to determine whether or not a mob is the *right* one, so I hope that helps ðŸ˜„

### Removed

- Unused config for spawning baby animals. This was a 1.14 thing only and I don't even remember if I properly implemented it tbh.

## 3.1.6

### Fixed

- [Hopefully] fixed issues with ChallengerMob particles
- Fixed Pillagers being able to become challengers, rendering them useless without their crossbow

## 3.1.5

### The 1.15 Update!


### Fixed

- Cake Tweaks not working -- definitely does now!

### Removed
